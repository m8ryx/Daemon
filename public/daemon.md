[ABOUT]

My name is Rick Rezinas and I love cooking, technology, gaming, and family. I am a fan of the Timbers and Thorns. You'll see me on the mountain on a pair of skis making poor decisions.

I've lived in Portland for over 30 years, having been brought here to attend Reed College where I earned my BA in Physics. Afterwards I obtained a Master's degree in Teaching, and promptly went into IT. I have focused on infrastructure and connection since then.

[CURRENT_LOCATION]

Currently home in Portland, Oregon

[MISSION]

Impact humanity positively by connecting democratization of technology and emerging capabilities with systems thinking and games. Foundationally, this is driven by the belief that empowering others elevates all.

[TELOS]

TELOS is my personal framework for tracking purpose and direction in life. It's a structured way to document Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, Goals to achieve, and Metrics to track progress. The name comes from the Greek word for purpose or end goal.

Problems (P) - The most important issues I see in the world that need solving:
- P1: Technology at scale yields great power with no demand for reflection or responsibility
- P2: Interconnection is a part of all lives, but the flow inherent in them compounds inequality
- P3: There are often many truths, but they can be drowned and misrepresented

Missions (M) - My approaches to addressing these problems:
- (To be developed)
