[TELOS]

TELOS is my personal framework for tracking purpose and direction in life. It's a structured way to document Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, Goals to achieve, and Metrics to track progress. The name comes from the Greek word for purpose or end goal.

Problems (P) - The most important issues I see in the world that need solving:
- P1: Technology at scale yields great power with no demand for reflection or responsibility
- P2: Interconnection is a part of all lives, but the flow inherent in them compounds inequality
- P3: There are often many truths, but they can be drowned and misrepresented

Missions (M) - My approaches to addressing these problems:
- (To be developed)
