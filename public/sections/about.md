[ABOUT]

My name is Rick Rezinas and I love cooking, technology, gaming, and family. I am a fan of the Timbers and Thorns. You'll see me on the mountain on a pair of skis making poor decisions.

I've lived in Portland for over 30 years, having been brought here to attend Reed College where I earned my BA in Physics. Afterwards I obtained a Master's degree in Teaching, and promptly went into IT. I have focused on infrastructure and connection since then.
